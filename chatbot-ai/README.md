A chatbot is an artificial intelligence (AI) program that simulates interactive human conversation by using key pre-calculated user phrases and auditory or text-based signals. Chatbots are frequently used for basic customer service and marketing systems that frequent social networking hubs and instant messaging (IM) clients. They are also often included in operating systems as intelligent virtual assistants.

A chatbot is also known as an artificial conversational entity (ACE), chat robot, talk bot, chatterbot or chatterbox.

Steps before you can run this on your machine:

1)Source code compatible with python 3.6 due to library dependencies
2)If you use conda then create an environment having python 3.6
 i> conda create -n "project name(acc your choice)" python=3.6
 ii> activate "project name"
 eg:conda create -n chatbot python=3.6
    activate chatbot
3)Install following libraries using pip
 i> nltk-natural language toolkit
 ii>numpy
 iii>tflearn
 iv>tensorflow(pip install tensorflow==1.4)
4)run the python file in your cmd terminal
  (pip main.py)[Note:intents.json and main.py to be kept in same directory/folder.Go to that folder and run the code]
5)If you have any problem fix pip(add to path -see internet for solution) and then redo the process
